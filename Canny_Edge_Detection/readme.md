The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. This project implements the Canny Edge Detection algorithm with the help of Sobel filters for gradient calculation. The approach involves noise reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding to detect edges in an image. The Sobel filters are applied to compute intensity gradients, which play a critical role in identifying strong and weak edges in the image.
